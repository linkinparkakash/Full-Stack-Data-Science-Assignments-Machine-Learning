    "Ans: K-fold Cross-Validation is when the dataset is split into a K number of folds and is used to evaluate the model's ability when given new data. K refers to the number of groups the data sample is split into. For example, if you see that the k-value is 5, we can call this a 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
